# ProjectEulerProblems
This is where I get a decent amount of mathematical algorithm exposure

# Daily Coding Problem (DCP)
I wanted more live coding practice and this seemed like the perfect opportunity

# Discretion
I know posting solutions to coding puzzles isn't very prim or proper, but I really want to document my growth and this felt like a nice medium of doing so. If someone other than me ends up reading this I hope you try them and grow too :^)
