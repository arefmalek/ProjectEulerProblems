# ProjectEulerProblems
This is where I get a decent amount of mathematical algorithm exposure
### UPDATE 2/18/2021
Not **very** important, but I just broke into the top 10 percent of all users
of the website :^)



## Naming Script
In all honesty if you want to take any of the work here just take the naming script it will save you time and scrapes from the website pretty smoothly, just make sure to have a folder named "Problems" at first because I didn't make the script check for the scenario where the folder doesn't exist


# Discretion
I know posting solutions to coding puzzles isn't very prim or proper, but I really want to document my growth and this felt like a nice medium of doing so. If someone other than me ends up reading this I hope you try them and grow too :^)
