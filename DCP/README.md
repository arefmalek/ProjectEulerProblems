# Daily Coding Problem

Link here: https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

I started these because I wanted to see how much I can really grow outside of school. It's only been day 2 so far, but I think the uphill battle will be really fun - I feel optimistic

## Discretion
I know posting solutions to coding puzzles isn't very prim or proper, but I really want to document my growth and this felt like a nice medium of doing so. If someone other than me ends up reading this I hope you try it and grow too :^)
